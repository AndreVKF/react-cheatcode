******* Named Exports *******
- create a Component folder with index.js(x)
- default export cames from index.js(x)

******* Component Re render *******
- Re render occurs by changing the component's state or props. When the component's 
state or props change, React will re-render the component to reflect changes.
- When the parent element re-renders, even if the component's state or props have not changed.
